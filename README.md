# WSSB-Constrution-Progress-Tracker
Simple program for checking details of foundational works and tracking progress of construction project operating under ridiculously limited manpower

# Existance of This Program
The site consists of only a site engineer, an architectural supervisor, a trainee, a safetly agent, a so-called project manager who only shows up once in a blue moon, around 5 laborers and one excavator operators constructing a 100+ footings project under the scpoe of civil & structure, however, efficiency was ridiculously low so this program was created to help handle huge pile of construction data as well as *assisting* (not replacing!) in QAQC job.

### This might be an abandon project since I already left this job
